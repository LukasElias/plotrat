# plotrat
Gonna be a graph calculator for ratatui, and possibly a microbit with a custom display

Ummm, I just realised that there's another library called [plotui](https://github.com/ybubnov/PlotUI), it's for making graph views in Swift UI's. And that's quite unfortunate for the naming of this crate. So I'll be renaming this to plotrat, so it plays on the words plot, rat, and portrait, which to my understanding isn't any other people's names for their projects.

## Ratatui challange
I wanted to make a graph calculator but I saw that ratatui had a [challenge](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/discussions/1886) going on. So this calculator is gonna be able to run one a custom screen I made with [this library](https://github.com/LukasElias/microbit-neopixel) (which I also made)
