Gonna be a graph calculator for ratatui, and possibly a microbit with a custom display

## Ratatui challange
I wanted to make a graph calculator but I saw that ratatui had a [challenge](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/discussions/1886) going on. So this calculator is gonna be able to run one a custom screen I made with [this library](https://github.com/LukasElias/microbit-neopixel) (which I also made)
